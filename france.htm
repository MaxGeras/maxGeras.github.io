<h1>France</h1>
<h3>Paris is the capital city of France.</h3>
<p>The military history of France during World War II covers three periods.<br> 
  From 1939 until 1940, which witnessed a war against Germany by the French<br> 
  Third Republic. The period from 1940 until 1945, which saw competition <br>
  between Vichy France and the Free French Forces under General Charles <br>
  de Gaulle for control of the overseas empire. In 1944 the Allies <br>
  (United States, Britain and others) invaded and took control <br>
  of France, expelling the Germans (except for a few ports the Germans kept).</p>
