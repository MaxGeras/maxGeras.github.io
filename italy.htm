<h1>Italy</h1>
<h3>Rome is the capital city of Italy.</h3>
<p>The Italian Campaign of World War II was the name of Allied operations in and<br> 
  around Italy, from 1943 to the end of the war in Europe. Joint Allied Forces<br> 
  Headquarters (AFHQ) was operationally responsible for all Allied land forces<br> 
  in the Mediterranean theatre, and it planned and commanded the invasion of <br>
  Sicily in July 1943, followed shortly thereafter in September by the invasion <br>
  of the Italian mainland and the campaign on Italian soil until the surrender <br>
  of the German Armed Forces in Italy in May 1945.</p>
