<h1>Germany</h1>
<h3>Berlin is the capital city of Germany.</h3>
<p>The German military system for reporting casualties was based on a numerical reporting<br>   of casualties by individual units and a separate listing of the names of individual<br>
  casualties. The system was not uniform because various military branches such as<br> 
  the Army, Air Force, Navy, Waffen SS and the military hospitals each had different<br> 
  systems of reporting. In early 1945 the German High Command (OKW)<br> 
  prepared a summary of total losses up to January 31, 1945.</p>
