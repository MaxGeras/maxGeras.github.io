<h1>Country Death TOLL WW2</h1>
<p>World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in <br>
absolute terms of total casualties. Over 60 million people were killed, <br> 
which was about 3% of the 1940 world population (est. 2.3 billion).[1] <br>
The tables below give a detailed country-by-country count of human losses.<br> 
World War II fatality statistics vary, with estimates of total deaths <br>
ranging from 50 million to more than 80 million.[2] The higher figure <br>
of over 80 million includes deaths from war-related disease and famine. <br>
Civilians killed totalled 50 to 55 million, including 19 to 28 million <br>
from war-related disease and famine. Total combat deaths: from 21 to 25 <br>
million, including deaths in captivity of about 5 million prisoners of war.</p>
