<h1>USA</h1>
<h3>Washington DC is the capital city of USA.</h3>
<p>The military history of the United States in World War II covers the war against <br>
  Japan, Germany and Italy starting with the 7 December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.<br> 
  During the first two years of World War II, the United States had maintained <br>
  formal neutrality as made officially in the 1937 Quarantine Speech delivered <br>
  by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 5 October 1937 in Chicago, while <br>
  supplying Britain, the Soviet Union, and China with war material through <br>
  the Lend-Lease Act which was signed into law on 11 March 1941, as well as <br>
  deploying the U.S. military to replace the British invasion forces in Iceland. <br> 
  In the Pacific Theater, there was unofficial early U.S. combat activity such <br>
  as the Flying Tigers. U.S. economic sanction on Japan as part of the effort to <br>
  deter Japanese military aggression in Asia-Pacific outraged the Empire of Japan <br>
  as the major cause of Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.[1][2] During the war, over <br>
  16 million Americans served in the United States Armed Forces, with 290,000 killed <br>
  in action and 670,000 wounded.[3] There were also 130,201 American prisoners of war, <br>
  of whom 116,129 returned home after the war.[4] </p>
